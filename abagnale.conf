# (Updated January 2026 - Applies worldwide)
#
#   THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED STRICTLY FOR **EDUCATIONAL, EXPERIMENTAL,
#   RESEARCH, TESTING, AND PERSONAL LEARNING PURPOSES ONLY**. IT IS NOT
#   INTENDED, DESIGNED, OR LICENSED FOR COMMERCIAL USE, PRODUCTION TRADING,
#   OR ANY FORM OF FINANCIAL SERVICE.
#
#   1. NO FINANCIAL, INVESTMENT, TRADING, OR REGULATED ADVICE
#
#     This software, its code, documentation, example strategies, backtests,
#     parameters, logs, or any associated materials DO NOT constitute:
#
#       o Investment advice.
#       o Financial advice.
#       o Trading recommendation.
#       o Portfolio management.
#       o Algorithmic trading service.
#       o Investment firm service (under MiFID II / MiCA in the EU/EEA).
#       o Commodity trading advice (under CFTC rules in the US).
#       o Any form of regulated financial or investment activity in ANY

#     extraordinarily high risk of losing **some, most, or ALL of your
#     capital**, potentially **more than 100%** in margin/leveraged
#     scenarios. Markets can move against you rapidly due to volatility,
#     liquidity issues, flash crashes, exchange failures, API changes,
#     black swan events, or code errors. **Past performance (including any
#     backtest, simulation, paper trade, or screenshot) is NEVER indicative
#     of future results.**
#
#   3. USE AT YOUR OWN EXCLUSIVE RISK - NO LIABILITY
#
#     TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW (INCLUDING UNDER EU CONSUMER
#     PROTECTION, US SECURITIES/COMMODITIES LAWS, AND EQUIVALENT RULES
#     WORLDWIDE):
#
#       o YOU ASSUME ALL RISKS associated with using this software.
#
#       o The author(s), contributors, maintainers, sponsors, affiliates,
#         and anyone connected to this project **DISCLAIM ALL LIABILITY**

#             fees, or damages.
#
#           o Bugs, logic errors, calculation mistakes, data feed issues,
#             API failures, exchange downtime/outages, rate-limit
#             violations, or security breaches.
#
#           o Hacks, stolen funds, compromised API keys, or
#             phishing/malware related to use.
#
#           o Regulatory enforcement, fines, account suspensions, legal
#             proceedings, or investigations.
#
#           o Any violation of exchange terms of service, local laws,
#             AML/CFT rules, tax obligations, or sanctions.
#
#   4. USER'S SOLE & EXCLUSIVE RESPONSIBILITY
#
#     By using this software you confirm that YOU ALONE are responsible
#     for:

#
#       o Auditing/reviewing/understanding EVERY line of code and its risks.
#
#       o Configuring risk controls (stop-loss, max drawdown, position
#         limits, kill switches, etc.).
#
#       o Monitoring execution continuously (automation does NOT mean
#         "set and forget").
#
#       o Complying with ALL applicable laws in YOUR jurisdiction, including
#         but not limited to:
#
#         **EU/EEA**:
#
#           MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation), MiFID II
#           (algorithmic trading rules), AMLR, consumer protection
#           laws - this software is NOT authorised under MiCA or MiFID II
#           and is NOT intended for distribution/use as a regulated
#           crypto-asset service or investment service.
#
#         **United States**:
#
#           CFTC (commodity/derivatives rules), SEC (securities laws),
#           FinCEN (AML), state money transmitter/BitLicense 
#           rules, etc. - automated trading may trigger registration if
#           used commercially or for others.
#
#         **Other jurisdictions**:
#
#           Equivalent rules (e.g., FCA UK, ASIC Australia, MAS Singapore,
#           JFSA Japan, etc.).

#       by ANY financial regulator worldwide (ESMA/EBA in EU, SEC/CFTC in
#       US, etc.).
#
#     o Distribution or use in ways that trigger licensing requirements
#       (e.g., providing to third parties, commercial deployment, acting as
#       intermediary) may be ILLEGAL in your country.

#     o In the EU/EEA: This is NOT a "crypto-asset service" under MiCA and
#       NOT investment advice/portfolio management under MiFID II.
#
#     o In the US: This is NOT commodity trading advice, investment advice,
#       or operation of an ATS/exchange.
#
#     o Users in prohibited/sanctioned jurisdictions (OFAC, EU sanctions
#       lists, etc.) MUST NOT use this software.
#
#   6. MANDATORY BEST PRACTICES (NON-NEGOTIABLE FOR SAFE USE)
#
#     o ALWAYS start and validate extensively in **dry-run / simulation /
#       paper-trading mode** NEVER go live without weeks/months of
#       successful testing.
#
#     o Use only tiny test amounts (if any) on real accounts initially.
#
#     o Implement independent safeguards (circuit breakers, alerts, manual
#       override).
#
#     o NEVER risk money you cannot afford to lose completely.
#
#   7. NO WARRANTY - AS IS, WITH ALL FAULTS

# Managing Database Connections
#   https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/ecpg-connect.html
#
#database target ABAGNALE user abagnale
#
# Garbage collect and optionally analyze a database
#   https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/sql-vacuum.html
#
# Note: Deleting data from the database does not automatically reclaim disk
# space. To not run into a disk full situation without any option to reclaim
# disk space e.g. by adding additional storage make sure to run
# 'abagnalectl vacuum' periodically.
# This deletes all plots as well as all outdated samples according to the
# given configuration after dumping to the output file given using the '-o'
# command line option compressed using 'xz'. The time this takes depends on
# the frequency vacuum is run. Also note that this process is run by the
# user the PostgreSQL server is run by. Make sure that user can write to
# the given output file.

# Managing Name Resolution
#   The following defaults will be used.
#
#dns-v4 udp://8.8.8.8:53
#dns-v6 udp://[2001:4860:4860::8888]:53

#exchange coinbase cdp-api-key /etc/abagnale/cdp_api_key.json

# Optional: Plot files may grow to a point at which plotting e.g. by using
# MATLAB or Octave requires more RAM than available to the system.
# Performing 'abagnalectl vacuum' periodically stops this from happening by
# deleting all plots from the database. Plots are considered temporary and
# are not dumped to the output file given using the '-o' command line
# option.

#  market [not] <pattern> ... - defaults to all tradeable markets. Multiple
#                               market keywords are matched using disjunction
#                               applying a first match wins strategy.

#                                   using a five minute window. To
#                                   distinguish between <percent> and
#                                   <nanos> the nanoseconds argument must
#                                   be quoted only when no suffix is
#                                   used (e.g. "1000" for one microsecond
#                                   instead of 1000 for 1000%).
# <nanos> [s | m | h | d | w]
#   Positive integer denoting nanoseconds optionally suffixed with a factor
#   
#   s: seconds
#   m: minutes
#   h: hours
#   d: days
#   w: weeks
#
# [not] <pattern> ...
#   Standard library for string operations and pattern-matching
#   Derived from Lua 5.3.1.
#     https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-7.8/patterns
#
#   Multiple patterns are supported and matched using conjunction.
#
#   Note: market not "A" "B" matches ( (NOT A) AND (B) ). If you wanted to
#   express ( (NOT A) AND (NOT B) ) the not keyword needs to
#   be repeated like: market not "A" not "B".
#
#   Example: market BTC@EUR market ETH@EUR market not SOL not DOGE
#   matches ( BTC@EUR OR ETH@EUR OR ( NOT SOL AND NOT DOGE ) )
#
# In it's most basic form, start with
#
#trade at coinbase using trend return 0.01 EUR
#
# Replace EUR with whatever account is available to you for trading.
# Make sure to run the application in verbose mode using the '-v'
# command line option and observe the application's output to get familiar
# with the processes involved. Run 'abagnalectl algorithms' or
# 'abagnalectl exchanges' to get a list of available algorithms or
# exchanges.
